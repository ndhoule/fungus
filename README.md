## Goals

- Puts the developer first:
  - Usable in browser and Node
  - Forward-thinking
    - Written in ES6
  - Lightweight
    - Doesn't use ES6 features if they bloat the runtime
  - Modular
    - Take only what you need
    - First-class support for environments where page weight is a concern
  - Well documented
    - Good documentation is just as important as code
  - Feels like JavaScript
    - Immediately familiar to Lodash, Underscore users
    - Pragmatic without sacrificing core FP tenets
    - Interfaces are as flexible as possible
  - Principle of least surprise as a design guideline
    - Smallest API possible
    - Alias common alternative names
    - Very well tested
  - Easy to understand
    - The project should shield you from digging into source whenever possible,
      but if you want to or need to, it should be easy to understand
    - Usable as a study guide for FP
