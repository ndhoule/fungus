## Goals
- Usable as ES6 modules
- Usable in node
- Usable in the browser
- Pragmatic without sacrificing core FP tenets
- API as familiar as possible to those who have used Underscore, Lodash, etc.
- Well tested and documented
- Easy-to-understand codebase / usable as a FP study guide
- Lightweight, doesn't use features from Traceur that require the Traceur runtime
- Modular: Take only what you need
