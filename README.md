# fungus

A functional programming library implemented using [ES6 features][ES6], compiled using [Google's Traceur compiler][Traceur].

[ES6]: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures
[Traceur]: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/


## Goals
- Well tested and documented
- To stay lightweight, doesn't use any Traceur features that require the (rather large) Traceur runtime
- To be as practical as possible, so long as it doesn't sacrifice core FP tenets
- Usable as ES6 modules or in modern browsers (add list of browsers here)
- Readable codebase -- usable as a FP study guide
